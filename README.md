# 100_days_of_code_python

As part of my journey to become a software developer, I have decided to learn Python.  I found a course on Udemy ([100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp for 2022](https://www.udemy.com/course/100-days-of-code/)) that I thought would be a fantastic entry into the world of Python.

### Day 1

The first day was an introduction into the basics of Python, string manipulation/variables, printing and inputs.  The project was to allow a user to input the city they grew up in and their pets name to help them create a new band name.

### Day 2

The second day's project was to create a simple tip calculator that would determine each persons portion of a bill plus the tip.

### Day 3

On the third day, the project was to create a simple text choose your own adventure style of game.

### Day 4

The fourth day's project had us create a rock, paper and scissors game that would have the user play against the computer.

### Day 5

On the fifth day, the course showed how to use loops in Python which culminated in a password generator application.
