# 100_days_of_code_python

As part of my journey to become a software developer, I have decided to learn Python.  I found a course on Udemy ([100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp for 2022](https://www.udemy.com/course/100-days-of-code/)) that I thought would be a fantastic entry into the world of Python.

### Day 1

The first day was an introduction into the basics of Python, string manipulation/variables, printing and inputs.  The project was to allow a user to input the city they grew up in and their pets name to help them create a new band name.

### Day 2

The second day's project was to create a simple tip calculator that would determine each persons portion of a bill plus the tip.

### Day 3

On the third day, the project was to create a simple text choose your own adventure style of game.

### Day 4

The fourth day's project had us create a rock, paper and scissors game that would have the user play against the computer.

### Day 5

On the fifth day, the course showed how to use loops in Python which culminated in a password generator application.

### Day 6

Day six brought me to [Reeborg's World](https://reeborg.ca/reeborg.html?lang=en&mode=python&menu=worlds%2Fmenus%2Freeborg_intro_en.json&name=Maze&url=worlds%2Ftutorial_en%2Fmaze1.json) to work with functions to get the robot to exit the maze.

### Day 7

The project on day 7 was a hangman game that used some nice ASCII art.  This was a pretty fun one!

### Day 8

Day 8's project was a simple command line take on Caesar's Cipher that asked the user if they wanted to encode or decode an inputted text and how many characters they wanted it to shift.

### Day 9

Day nine introduced Dictionaries and we used them to create a simple command line auction program.

### Day 10

The project on day 10 was a command line calculator that added, subtracted, multiplied and divided 2 inputted numbers.  You also allowed the user to continue calculating with the previous result, start a new calculation or exit the calculator.
